Anita is a MS student working in the PAPER Lab. She is a McNair Scholar originally from Northern Colorado, where she got her degree in Anthropology (Biological), and minored in French. She has three cats, enjoys electronics, the Metro, and science education. Her research focuses on understanding the functional morphology of early hominin and modern humans' lower limbs by studying their trackways and anatomical differences distally from the pelvis. She is interested in what this can tell us about ancient environments and populations.
