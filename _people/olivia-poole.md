As an undergraduate student at GW, Olivia studied biology with a personal interest in Chinese language and literature. Her interests within the PAPER lab included comparative osteology, faunal analysis, and 3D scanning. Olivia helped build the labâ€™s comparative osteology collection by curating various skeletons including baboons, cows, and a Shetland pony.  She worked on a 3D geometric morphometrics project studying the ecomorphology of bovid radioulna.
